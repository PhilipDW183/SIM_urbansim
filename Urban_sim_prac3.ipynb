    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Last workshop we built on our knowledge of unconstrained models by introducing the two singly constrained models. Within these models, more information can be added in, if it is available, in order to improve model fit and we covered some potential use cases. We could see that by adding constraints in the model, using information that we already had, could improve how well the model is able to model flows between boroughs but also we could choose the model depending on the what behaviour or values we would like to change to see how it would in theory affect flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will build on that by introducing the doubly constrained model which contains as much information as possible into the model. Before that however we need to bring in the data from the first practical so taht we can use it to cmopare the results of the new practical:"

    "With these parameters, the inverse power function has a far more rapid distance decay effect than the negative exponential function. In real life, what this means is that if the observed interactions drop off very rapidly with distance, then they might be more likely to follow an inverse power law. This might be the case when looking at trips to the local convenience store by walking, for example. On the other hand, if the effect of distance is less severe (for example migration across the country for a new job) then the negative exponential funtion might be more appropriate.\n",

    "## 5. Conclusions, further notes and ideas for additional activities\n",
    "Hopefully you have now seen how it is extremely straight-forward to run and calibrate Wilson’s full family of Spatial Interaction Models in R using GLM and Poisson Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Some Further Notes\n",
    "Now might be the time to mention that despite everything I’ve shown you, there has been some discussion in the literature as to whether the Poisson Model is actually a misspecification, especially for modelling migration flows. If you have the stomach for it, [this paper by Congdon goes into a lot of detail.](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/a251481)\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is a thing called ‘overdispersion’ which, translated, essentially relates to the model not being able to capture all of the things that could be explaining the flows in the independent variables that are supplied to the model. The details are tedious and only really intelligible to those with a statistics background. If you want a starter, [try here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdispersion), but in practical terms, we can get around this problem by fitting a very similar sort of regression model called the negative binomial regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish, you can read up and experiment with this model - you can fit it in exactly the same way as the poisson glm model but using: family = sm.families.NegativeBinomial(alpha) when you call the statsmodel glm function. The negative binomial model has an extra parameter - alpha - in the model for overdispersion with a default of 1. If you do try this, you will almost certainly discover that your results barely change - but hell, you might keep a pedantic reviewer at bay if you submit this to a journal (not that I’m speaking from experience or anything).\n",
    "\n",
    "### And some more comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note is that the example we used here had quite neat data. You will almost certainly run into problems if you have sparse data or predictors with 0s in them. If this happens, then you might need to either drop some rows in your data (if populated with 0s) or substitute 0s for very small numbers, much less than 1, but greater than 0 (this is because you can’t take the log of 0). [Taylor Oshan's SpInt](http://openjournals.wu.ac.at/region/paper_175/175.html) implementation in Python uses a special Poisson regression approach that better handles sparse data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "And another thing to note is that our flow data and our predictors were all in and around the same order or magnitude. If you suddenly get data that (such as population masses at origins and destinations) that are an order of magnitude different (i.e. populations about ten times larger in different locations) then the model estimates might be biased. Fortunately, there are packages available to help us with these problems as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Further Activities\n",
    "1. Testing these models out on the whole of London and for different years\n",
    "    - You’ve been playing around with just a small 7 borough sample, why not try the full London system. +You can also try and download some similar data from the 2011 Census from [Wicid](http://wicid.ukdataservice.ac.uk/) - see if using Oi and Dj totals and the parameters you calibrated on the 2001 data, whether you can get reasonable estimates of the 2011 flows. +How have the model parameters changed between 2001 and 2011 - what does this mean\n",
    "2. Visualising your flow estimates\n",
    "    - try using the methods  last practical to visualise some of your flow estimates or flow residuals…"

    "## Challenge to complete\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge to complete is to run every possible model (unconstrained, production constrained, attraction constrained and doubly constrained) with each distance decay function (power, exponential) on the total dataset and to extract each models paramaters, along with each models performance metrics ($R2$, $RMSE$). For this, you will need to go back to the original workshop to be able to extract the full `cdata` dataset which will be used here (push the data to a csv and then read it in here).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you should be able to cobble togther rather basic code to implement each model and then extract their performance and paramaters. To this end, you will not be given any comment hints. You can do this manually or you could create a loop to iterate over each model to save on code, this is up to you. Good luck!"
